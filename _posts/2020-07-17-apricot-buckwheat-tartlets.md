<p class="has-drop-cap">Every year in the early spring I silently hope that this will be the year for the apricots, meaning no frost or bad weather once the apricot trees are blooming. Sadly, for the past several years it has been just that, hail, freezing temperatures or strong southern winds destroying most of the delicate apricot flowers. Some of the stronger and brave ones survive to provide us with nature's best gift, the fruit.</p>

<p>I always loved apricots, especially the apricot tree in my grandmother's garden. It was one of those old trees looking after generations to enjoy an afternoon coffee under its trunk, or the juicy and sweet fruit in the early summer. Sadly that tree is gone now, leaving only the pleasant memories forever to be cherished.</p>

<p>The combination of buckwheat and apricots was always one of my favorite and this simple tart gives the delicate subtle taste of the buckwheat and the explosive sweet acidic taste of the apricots.</p>
