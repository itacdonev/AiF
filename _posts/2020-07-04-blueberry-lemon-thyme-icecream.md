<p class="has-drop-cap">Blueberries are in full season now and it would be a shame not to pair them with some fresh lemon thyme, which is also proudly presenting itself in the garden with beautiful pinkish purple flowers, and make some swirl ice cream. The freshness and the zesty lemony taste of the thyme pairs really nicely with the blueberries providing that zingy summer treat in 30C weather outside. If you don't have lemon thyme, you can add some lemon zest, preferably from the Meyer lemon.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The base for this swirl ice cream is the classic creamy<b> vanilla ice cream</b>. Blueberries and lemon thyme do provide for the main flavor, but I believe that the base is equally important. The process of making the vanilla ice cream is quite straitforward, but it can also go in the wrong direction, if the eggs are overcooked and they start to resemble scramble eggs rather than a creamy texture. Don't worry if this happens, there is a quick fix. Just take the hand blender and thoroughly mix everything until you don't see any scrambled eggs texture but rather a creamy flowing custard.</p>
