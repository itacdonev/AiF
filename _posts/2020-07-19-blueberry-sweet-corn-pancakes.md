<p class="has-drop-cap">Sweet corn is one of those versatile grains which can be the star of any type of a dish starting with the soup and ending with a dessert. How about we start with breakfast first? I always loved the traditional pancakes with fresh blueberries, which in our family we traditionally make almost every weekend. But now, having tried these, I think this is my new favorite. Also, everyone else loves them. So it's a win-win!</p>

<p>The creaminess of the sweet corn makes these pancakes so light, melt in your mouth. Pure pleasure.</p>
<p>The key here is that the corn should be just ripe and not overripe. When you poke the corn grain with your finger, lots of "corn milk" should come out, the grains should be appropriately formed, and the yellow color should be on the pastel side. This way the corn mixes well with the batter and is not grainy at all, except for the few whole grains I usually leave on purpose.</p>
<p>If the corn is too old, it will not be as creamy, and there might be more of a "grainy" taste in the pancakes.</p>

<p>Blueberries in this recipe should be fresh. If you only have frozen ones, let them thaw on the kitchen counter until they reach room temperature. Having blueberries at room temperature will enable the pancakes to cook more evenly in the middle. If you add frozen blueberries, the part of the dough with blueberries will reach cooking temperature much later resulting in more cooking time and a bit dryer pancakes.</p>
<p>Once the blueberries are ready at room temperature, don't add them to the mixture as you would with the fresh ones. This is because they are not so compact anymore (due to the freezing process), and they will release plenty of color into your dough, which will turn the pancakes more purple then creamy yellow. If you don't mind this little color effect then no problem, just don't overmix the batter.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<p>To achieve light and airy pancakes, the structure of the batter is essential.</p>
<p>First, I always separate the egg yolk and the whites and whip the whites to be added at the end of the batter mixing process. This gives a considerable boost to the lightness of the pancake. Just make sure not to overmix the batter when adding the whites to the rest of the batter, as it will lose the airy structure we want.</p>
<p>Second, the batter should not be too thick, but a bit on a looser side and not runny. The best test is when you pour the batter in the pan. It should level and set but not overflow around the edges as the heat of the pan kicks in.</p>
<p>Third, the batter should rest for a short time, like 10 minutes, before cooking.</p>

<p>These pancakes will be a bit on the darker side when cooked due to blueberries. While cooking, you will notice little bubbles of blueberry juice popping out, so when you flip the pancakes to cook on the other side, these juices will burn slightly. Don't worry, it doesn't make the pancakes bitter or anything like that, just slightly darker in color. It is beneficial to scrape the pan with a wooden spatula after each round of cooking to remove the blueberry residues.</p>

<p>Serve the pancakes warm, with some extra blueberries (there can never be too many blueberries on the plate ðŸ˜‰), and drizzle some good maple syrup.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
